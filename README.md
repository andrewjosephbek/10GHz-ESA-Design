# Electrically Small Loop Antenna @ 10 MHz
## Full EM + Circuit Co-Simulation in ADS, Matching Network Design, and Performance Characterization

This repository contains the full workflow and report for designing a 10 MHz electrically small loop antenna (ESA) on 60 mil Rogers RO3003, matched to a 50 Ω feed using a PCB-implemented magnetic coupling structure. The project includes analytical calculations, ADS schematic simulations, Momentum EM simulations, and final performance evaluation (Q-factor, efficiency, S-parameters, radiation patterns, and far-field behavior).

This work was completed as part of a study on electrically small antennas, matching methods, and ADS co-simulation techniques.
